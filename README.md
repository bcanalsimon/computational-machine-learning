# Computational Machine Learning

## Extended project 1: KNN and SVM.

The aim of this project is to predict the probability of death for patients entering an ICU (Intensive Care Unit). This analysis uses the MIMIC dataset available from [Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care](https://mimic.physionet.org/).

- [SVM Implementation](link-to-svm-file)

**Note**: The preprocessing of the data is the same for both the KNN and SVM implementations, with the difference that SVM handle class imbalance.


## Extended project 2: Decision Trees, Ensembles and Neural Networks.

The aim of this project is to predict the length of stay of a patient that is entering an ICU (Intensive Care Unit). This analysis uses the MIMIC dataset available from [Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care](https://mimic.physionet.org/).

**Note**: The performance metric used is *RMSE* (Root Mean Squared Error).
