# Computational Machine Learning

The aim of this project is to predict the probability of death for patients entering an ICU (Intensive Care Unit). This analysis uses the MIMIC dataset available from [Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care](https://mimic.physionet.org/).

## Extended project 1: KNN and SVM.

### Files
- [KNN Implementation](link-to-knn-file)
- [SVM Implementation](link-to-svm-file)

**Note**: The preprocessing of the data is the same for both the KNN and SVM implementations, with the difference that SVM handle class imbalance.


## Extended project 2: Decision Trees, Ensembles and Neural Networks.

- [Advanced Modeling Techniques](link-to-project-2-folder)

**Note**: The performance metric used is *RMSE* (Root Mean Squared Error), which measures the differences between predicted and observed values.
